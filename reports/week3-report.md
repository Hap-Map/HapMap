## Progress & Issues

  - Worked on use cases, specifically how the user begins navigation. This helped us identify edge cases where an error should be thrown or when the user needs to provide more input before app can begin a request to Navigation API.
  - Set-up environment. Downloaded Flutter, Andriod Studio and Dart plug-in and Visualizer. I think I'm the only one on the team unfamiliar with these tools so while I've been setting up locally my teammates have done a good job setting the repo up.
  - Researching Google Cloud Services that we will use for our project: Google Navigation API and Google Places API. It's been difficult to come up with clear goals as far as the backend goes without being familiar with how these APIs work. Now that I'm a bit more familiar I have a better idea of the type of request/responses we can expect from these APIs and begin thinking about how to integrate them into our project.

## Next Steps

- Lauren:
  - Enable Google Navigation API
  - Prepare request to Navigation API. Start with hard coding then make dynamic based on current location and search.
  - Organize response recieved into data that can be used by other parts of the application.  The data we can expect to receive includes: step-by-step directions (including HTML instructions and lat/long endpoints), ETA, total distance
  - Goals beyond next week:
    - Using the returned data from Google Navigation API, come up with a way to integrate Flutter location and haptic touch
    - Determine how app should handle when a user takes a wrong turn
    - Refine location for input and destination search (Google Places API)
