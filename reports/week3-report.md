# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
N/A

## Progress & Issues
Completed requirements and policies document and submitted. We are currently at the start of our project and are familiarizing ourselves with our tech stack. No issues at the moment, and workflow has been efficient.

## Next Steps
Focus on learning or reviewing Flutter and Dart. For front-end developers, plan to work on creating basic wireframes and designs. For back-end developers, plan to work on exploring Google APIs for the project.

## Last Week's Goals
N/A

## Progress & Issues
- Emily: This week I have been learning more about Dart/Flutter for project implementation. Something I worked on is the requirements document, which outlines what the project will need as we move forward. There haven't been any issues yet since we are still very early in the project.
- Pulkit: Worked on requirements doc, and pushed a new flutter project to the git.
- Simona:
- Lauren: Worked on use cases identifying edge cases where an error should be thrown or user needs to provide more input. Set-up environment by downloading Andriod studio, Dart and Flutter. Researched Google Cloud services and familiarized with APIs. Without knowing how our project would integrate the google navigation APIs, it was hard to set a clear timeline/goals from the backend perspective. We now have a better idea of the request/responses of the APIS and can begin setting more defined goals.
- Aditya: Worked on setting up the repository and organization for the project on GitHub. Also worked on the policies and requirements document.
- Jesse: Worked on and finished requirements and policies document, attended weekly meetings, and reviewed Flutter documentation.

## Next Steps
- Emily: I plan on continuing to explore Flutter and Dart, as well as starting to work on the layout and wireframes for the application. This could be done through simple sketches, figma wireframes, or even simple layouts on Flutter.
- Pulkit: Work on a Flutter prototype and explore/integrate libraries and APIs we will use.
- Simona:
- Lauren: 
  - Enable Google Navigation API
  - Prepare request to Navigation API. Start with hard coding then make dynamic based on current location and search.
  - Organize response recieved into data that can be used by other parts of the application.  The data we can expect to receive includes: step-by-step directions (including HTML instructions and lat/long endpoints), ETA, total distance
  - Goals beyond next week:
    - Using the returned data from Google Navigation API, come up with a way to integrate Flutter location and haptic touch
    - Determine how app should handle when a user takes a wrong turn
    - Refine location for input and destination search (Google Places API)
- Aditya:
  - Working on getting more familiarity with Flutter and Dart
  - Starting Google Maps API integration into our project
  - Working on other backend tasks and other project modules
- Jesse: Increase understanding of Flutter, Dart, and any additional relevant packages and libraries that could serve useful in our project. Focus on creating basic wireframes and design for application.
