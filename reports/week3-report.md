# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals

## Progress & Issues
Completed requirements and policies document and submitted. We are currently at the start of our project, and are familiarizing ourselves with our tech stack. No issues at the moment, and workflow has been efficient.
## Next Steps
Focus on learning or reviewing Flutter and Dart. For front-end developers, plan to work on creating basic wireframes and designs. For back-end developers, plan to work on exploring Google API's for the project.

# Team Contributions

## Last Week's Goals

- Emily: I worked on seting up the requirements document to be filled out for week 3, as well as filling it in as needed. At this point the document was the main task as we are still early in the development process.
- Pulkit:
- Simona:
- Lauren:
- Aditya:
- Jesse: Worked on requirements and policies document and attending weekly meetings.

## Progress & Issues
- Emily: This week I have been learning more about Dart/Flutter for project implementation. Something I worked on is the requirements document, which outlines what the project will need as we move forward. There haven't been any issues yet since we are still very early in the project.
- Pulkit: Worked on requirements doc, and pushed a new flutter project to the git.
- Simona:
- Lauren:
  - Worked on use cases, specifically how the user begins navigation. This helped us identify edge cases where an error should be thrown or when the user needs to provide more input before app can begin a request to Navigation API.
  - Set-up environment. Downloaded Flutter, Andriod Studio and Dart plug-in and Visualizer. I think I'm the only one on the team unfamiliar with these tools so while I've been setting up locally my teammates have done a good job setting the repo up.
  - Researching Google Cloud Services that we will use for our project: Google Navigation API and Google Places API. It's been difficult to come up with clear goals as far as the backend goes without being familiar with how these APIs work. Now that I'm a bit more familiar I have a better idea of the type of request/responses we can expect from these APIs and begin thinking about how to integrate them into our project.
- Aditya:
- Jesse: Worked on and finished requirements and policies document, reviewed Flutter documentation.

## Next Steps
- Emily: I plan on continuing to explore Flutter and Dart, as well as starting to work on the layout and wireframes for the application. This could be cone through simple sketches, figma wireframes, or even simple layouts on Flutter.
- Pulkit: Work on a Flutter prototype and explore/integrate libraries and APIs we will use.
- Simona:
- Lauren:
  - Enable Google Navigation API
  - Prepare request to Navigation API. Start with hard coding then make dynamic based on current location and search.
  - Organize response recieved into data that can be used by other parts of the application.  The data we can expect to receive includes: step-by-step directions (including HTML instructions and lat/long endpoints), ETA, total distance
  - Goals beyond next week:
    - Using the returned data from Google Navigation API, come up with a way to integrate Flutter location and haptic touch
    - Determine how app should handle when a user takes a wrong turn
    - Refine location for input and destination search (Google Places API)
- Aditya:
- Jesse: Increase understanding of Flutter, Dart, and any additional relevant packages and libraries that could serve useful in our project. Focus on creating basic wireframes and design for application.
