# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
Tasks consisted primarily of integrating newly updated features. For the final release, we planned on polishing and making sure everything works.

## Progress & Issues
We have built a release of HapMap for android and have the core functionality working!

Remaining issue(s):
- Minor cosmetic issues (depending on device size)

HapMap is not currently uploaded to the Play Store or App Store due to resource (API credit) restrictions.

## Next Steps

## Last Week's Goals

- Pulkit: Add distance to next step to the navigation page, work on remaining front-end issues
- Simona: Finish implementing & testing the shake response, and finish accessibility testing for new pages
