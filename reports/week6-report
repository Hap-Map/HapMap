# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
We plan on finishing the basic layout of our app within Flutter (i.e. transfer our Figma design's buttons, text, etc.) and start implementing 
features such as navigation and haptic/vibration feedback. For the backend, we hope to get some workable data which we can test with our functions 
once they are implemented, as well as expanded functionality to format data on displays.
- Work on getting addresses from lat/long values, and vice versa
- Explore how to integrate a map UI from Google
- Add speech-to-text for audio input
- Add widgets/text to the remaining pages

During our project meeting, we plan on first discussing any remaining concerns about software tools, and then doing progress checks. Then, we will 
move onto reviewing the timeline for our project and the different tasks we will work on.
