# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
Focus on learning or reviewing Flutter and Dart. For front-end developers, plan to work on creating basic wireframes and designs. For back-end developers, plan to work on exploring Google APIs for the project.

During our project meeting, we plan on first discussing any remaining concerns about software tools. Then, we will move onto reviewing the timeline for our project and the different tasks we will work on. At this point we might ask for some feedback from the project manager to help gauge which areas of the project might need the most attention.

## Progress & Issues
We each worked on our respective front-end and back-end tasks. We currently have a fully setup working environment for our application implementation as well as a polished UI through Figma. 
The frontend is currently implementing the various pages and has the basic skeleton programmed, and the backend is currently exploring the APIs to be used.
- Everyone has their environment set up
- Implemented basic layout of all the pages on Flutter
- Implemented TypeAhead Searchbar (only provides hard-code suggestions currently)
- Not yet decided on the theme and colors of the application, but we know we intend to use visual accessibility friendly colors.

## Next Steps
We plan on finishing the basic layout of our app within flutter (i.e. transfer our Figma design's buttons, text, etc.) and start implementing various functions. For the backend, we hope to get some workable data which we can test with our functions once they are implemented.
- Work on integrating the Places Autocomplete API for our suggestions
- Decide on and develop consistent styles, themes, icon(s) for our app
- Add speech-to-text for audio input
- Add widgets/text to the remaining pages

# Team Contributions

## Last Week's Goals
- Emily: I plan on continuing to explore Flutter and Dart, as well as starting to work on the layout and wireframes for the application. This could be done through simple sketches, figma wireframes, or even simple layouts on Flutter.
- Pulkit: Work on a Flutter prototype and explore/integrate libraries and APIs we will use.
- Simona: I will work on getting more familiar with Flutter and Dart, by using the resources Emily shared in the group. Potentially will work on the wireframe with other team members who are also Flutter Developers.
- Lauren:
  - Enable Google Navigation API
  - Prepare request to Navigation API. Start with hard coding then make dynamic based on current location and search.
  - Organize response recieved into data that can be used by other parts of the application.  The data we can expect to receive includes: step-by-step directions (including HTML instructions and lat/long endpoints), ETA, total distance
  - Goals beyond next week:
    - Using the returned data from Google Navigation API, come up with a way to integrate Flutter location and haptic touch
    - Determine how app should handle when a user takes a wrong turn
    - Refine location for input and destination search (Google Places API)
- Aditya:
  - Working on getting more familiarity with Flutter and Dart
  - Starting Google Maps API integration into our project
  - Working on other backend tasks and other project modules
- Jesse: Increase understanding of Flutter, Dart, and any additional relevant packages and libraries that could serve useful in our project. Focus on creating basic wireframes and design for application.

## Progress & Issues
- Emily: This week I have been learning more about Dart/Flutter for project implementation. Something I worked on is the requirements document, which outlines what the project will need as we move forward. There haven't been any issues yet since we are still very early in the project.
- Pulkit: Built a basic layout for each page in Flutter and added routes to finish the app's basic view flow.
- Simona: I worked on updated the figma wireframe created by Jesse for more accessible design, and set up the Trello board for task management.
- Lauren: Integrated the Google Nagivation API and created directions model 
- Aditya: Worked on setting up the repository and organization for the project on GitHub. Also worked on the policies and requirements document.
- Jesse: Designed the main Figma wireframe for our application and wrote draft for weekly report.

## Next Steps
- Emily: I plan on continuing to explore Flutter and Dart, as well as starting to work on the layout and wireframes for the application. This could be done through simple sketches, figma wireframes, or even simple layouts on Flutter.
- Pulkit: Add functionality and styling to existing widgets, connect widgets with controllers and models.
- Simona: I will work on styling the search page of the Flutter App
- Lauren: 
  - Implement Places API for suggestion search
  - Create Place data object
  - Use Place object returned from search and enable place_id search from Directions API
  - Goals beyond next week
    - Get Maps API working for background of UI. Using polylines we want to be able to show the route which will update in real time using a users location
- Aditya:
  - Working on getting more familiarity with Flutter and Dart
  - Starting Google Maps API integration into our project
  - Working on other backend tasks and other project modules
- Jesse: Design an additional settings page for our application and start implementing various parts of the app through flutter.
