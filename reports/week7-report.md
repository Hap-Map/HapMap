# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
We planned on finishing the essential features and pages of the application for the upcoming beta release. Specifically, this would include a working navigation page and working navigation along a route. This includes tasks like getting and updating directions, styling the page, adding haptic touch, and including text-to-speech for announcements. We will also continue to add tests and work on getting them to run in CI.

## Progress & Issues
We each worked on our respective front-end and back-end tasks. Frontend is finishing the navigation and confirmation pages, such as implementing the user navigation. Backend is fixing API-related issues as they come up. The CI build is now fully functional with usage of Github Secrets. We've also completed our beta release.

Current issues to be addressed are:
- Directions are not being updated during navigation
- Missing spoken directions
- Missing haptic/vibration feedback

## Next Steps
We will continue to build out the features of HapMap such as navigation and haptic feedback. We will also begin to lay out and implement other pages, such as the help and settings pages. In addition, we will continue adding some unit tests as needed.

During our project meeting, we plan on doing progress checks. Then, we will move onto identifying key tasks that still need to be completed and setting deadlines for when each should be done.
