# HapMap
<img src="https://github.com/Hap-Map/HapMap/blob/main/images/hapmap_logo.png?raw=true" alt="hapmap_logo" width="200"/>
HapMap is a sensory navigation application that makes independent travel more accessible for low-vision individuals. It utilizes a combination of auditory, haptic, and vibration cues to inform users of their route. For example: as the user approaches a turn, the frequency of the haptic feedback increases to indicate their proximity to the turn. This reduces the uncertainty that comes with standard navigation systems that may abruptly give instructions.

## Repo Layout
**HapMap/lib**: Files to run, edit, and integrating Google Map API to the flutter app
- **HapMap/lib/API/** Files related to Google Maps API endpoint and returned data structures
- **HapMap/lib/pages** Layouts and functionality for front-end UI
- **HapMap/lib/constants.dart** global constants
- **HapMap/lib/main.dart** Application entry point

**HapMap/reports**: Weekly reports and meeting agenda

## Set Up Environment
There are a few installations that are needed in order to build, run, and test HapMap.
- [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Download & Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
- [Create a Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#system-image) (Android devices are recommended)
  - If using an iOS Simulator, note that [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is required and that it cannot simulate a route/travel

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository
2. Add one API key for Google Places and Directions to a dart file in `lib/api/.key` such that `const MAPS_API_KEY="API KEY"`. Make sure the file is imported into directions_api.dart and place_api.dart and that the import statement for `api/maps.dart` is removed! We have included an empty `actions.dart` file for you to put the key in, or you may create your own. Also be sure to include the API key in `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` and `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
3. Open an iOS or Android emulator or [connect a physical device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) in Android Studio
4. In the command line, navigate to the HapMap directory and run `bash clean_and_run.sh` to build the app

## How to Test
### Simulating a Route
For tips on how to use an Android emulatior, please see the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)

### Automated Tests
1. See the "How to Build" section for instructions to set up the project locally
2. In the top-level directory, run `flutter test` to run all test files in the /test folder

To add tests, create a new file in the test folder in the format \<what_is_being_tested\>_test.dart

For help with testing, view the [Dart Testing Documentation](https://dart.dev/guides/testing)
