# HapMap

HapMap is a sensory navigation application that makes independent travel more accessible for low-vision individuals. It utilizes a combination of auditory, haptic, and vibration cues to inform users of their route. For example: as the user approaches a turn, the frequency of the haptic feedback increases to indicate their proximity to the turn. This reduces the uncertainty that comes with standard navigation systems that may abruptly give instructions.

## Repo Layout
**HapMap/lib**: Files to run, edit, and integrating Google Map API to the flutter app \
- **HapMap/lib/API/** Files related to Google Maps API endpoint and returned data structures \
- **HapMap/lib/pages** Layouts and functionality for front-end UI \
- **HapMap/lib/constants.dart** global constants \
- **HapMap/lib/main.dart** Application entry point \
**HapMap/reports**: Weekly reports and meeting agenda

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository
2. Create private folder in the api directory called .key such that the path is `/api/.key`
3. Add one API key for Google Places and Directions to a dart file in `/api/.key` such that `MAPS_API_KEY="API KEY"`
4. Open an iOS or Android emulator or connect a physical device (such as in Android Studio)
5. In the command line, navigate to the HapMap directory and run 'bash clean_and_run.sh' to build the app

## How to Test
1. See the "How to Build" section for instructions to set up the project locally
2. In the top-level directory, run `flutter test` to run all test files in the /test folder

To add tests, create a new file in the test folder in the format \<what_is_being_tested\>_test.dart

For help with testing, view the [Dart Testing Documentation](https://dart.dev/guides/testing)
