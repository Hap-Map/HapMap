## What is HapMap (high-level description)

## Installation

## Run HapMap

Whenever you need walking directions to a destination, the HapMap app can be quite useful. To start up the app, follow the following instructions:
### For Android:
Go to your smartphone's app drawer and navigate to the HapMap app. If you are having trouble finding the app, you can try these options:
- Ask the Google Assistant
- Use your smartphone's built-in search functionality to find and open the app.

### For iOS:
Navigate to the HapMap app on the home screen pages. If the app is not visible there, you can try these options:
- Ask Siri to open the app
- Use the search functionality (by dragging downwards on the home screen)
- Navigate to the list of all apps (after the last home screen page) to find and open the app.

If you still cannot find the app on your smartphone, verify that you followed the steps in the [Installation section](#Installation), otherwise contact us for further troubleshooting.


## Use HapMap

Once you have started the HapMap app, location permission will requested in order for you to get correct directions based on your location. You will need to provide permission for precise location updates while using the app in order for the app to work. If you deny permission, the system app settings page will be opened up so that you can manually allow the requested permission.
You can then enter the desired destination and a list of suggestions will be shown. If you are using TalkBack/VoiceOver, the app is designed for intuitive interactions with dictation services.
Once a particular destination is selected, you will be redirected to a confirmation page where you can see the destination, the name of the current location, and the estimated time it will take to reach the destination.
When you click the "Start Navigation" button, the navigation starts and the directions and destination are displayed on the screen. The current location keeps updating as you move.
Whenever you reach the next step, your phone will vibrate, give haptic feedback, and display (or announce, if using dictation services) the next direction.
For the in-app tutorial, you can go to the help section from the search page (the "?" floating button on the lower-right corner).

## Known Bug

You can also navigate to the "Issues" tab following the above instructions to find out the current/identified bugs by developers and other users. Currently, because we are still in the process of implementing HapMap, most of the issues are around implementing the full functionality of HapMap. You can expect those usability/implement issues to be solved by the final release date. Otherwise, some known bugs include:

* Directions on the navigation page not moving to next direction at appropriate time
* Haptic Touch missing from navigation
