## Obtain the Source Code
Navigate to the "Code" button on the repository. Ensure it is on the main branch. Clone the repository to your local machine accordingly, following [Github's official Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) as needed. You should be able to now open the project in your IDE of choice (ours is Android Studio).
